# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Notes

Right now things look a little on the rough side because this is still in active development and, quite frankly, I'm still trying to find design inspiration for some of the views.

## Branches

#### master

As soon as things or pushed to this branch, Netlify pulls, builds, and deploys. This is my true master branch with CICD.

#### dev

This is where I make my changes and workout the kinks. Also, I wrote blog posts in this branch. Once everything looks good, I merge into master.

#### redesign

This is my visual redesign branch. I'm not 100% happy with how things look and have some regrets about my initial retro-game inspired decisions. This is my playground for redesigning the site.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO

- The nav theme switching is neat, but it needs work (especially the nav icons on the about page).
- add more Google Analytics functionality
- dev the game library backend in a different repo, stand it up on a DO server, then build a no-ssr view to display my games library in tables with visualizations

## OVERALL TODO

- maybe I need a logo? If I decide to do this, I should see about one of those site where you pay a small fee and people take a crack at it?
- add accessibility
- the blog sections are eventually going to need pagination, archives, or something because a million posts on the page isn't acceptable - mayeb infinite scroll?
- konami code easter egg trigger works, now think of something fun for it to do
- make remaining views (My VG library view, gallery of my game collection, and what else if anything?)
