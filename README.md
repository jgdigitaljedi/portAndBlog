## Notes

Right now things look a little on the rough side because this is still in active development and, quite frankly, I'm still trying to find design inspiration for some of the views.

## CURRENT FOCUS TODO

- The nav theme switching is neat, but it needs work (especially the nav icons on the about page).
- add more Google Analytics functionality
- dev the game library backend in a different repo, stand it up on a DO server, then build a no-ssr view to display my games library in tables with visualizations

## OVERALL TODO

- maybe I need a logo? If I decide to do this, I should see about one of those site where you pay a small fee and people take a crack at it?
- add accessibility
- the blog sections are eventually going to need pagination, archives, or something because a million posts on the page isn't acceptable
- konami code easter egg trigger works, now think of something fun for it to do
- make remaining views (My VG library view, gallery of my game collection, and what else if anything?)
